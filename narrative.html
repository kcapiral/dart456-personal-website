            </div>Hello there. I’m a graphic and user interface designer based in Montreal.
                  My works involve designing websites, visual identities, and promotional materials.
                  Currently, I’ve been exploring with minimalism and functionalism
                  in design of the two dimensional environment. I love to design with purpose, and
                  create meaningful experiences for the audience while meeting client objectives.
                  When I’m not designing, I’m most likely playing a video game or watching anime (Y).<br />
            <br />Say hi to me! kathleen.capiral@gmail.com

            <a href="https://www.rezo-zero.com" target="_blank"><i>Rezo Zero</i></a> is studio that really fits with the type of projects I do and the style of visuals I enjoy designing. Their skills range from traditional graphic design of brand identities and print to modern digital designs of UI/UX, front end, back end and admin systems. However, their strength lies in their works of digital design, as you can tell that their approach to the graphics and functionality of their website designs are unique and the aesthetic styles are exclusive to them. <br />

            <br />Although Rezo Zero has a variety of clients in different fields, they were able to incorporate as they say, “aesthetics and technical performances”, which is a balance needed especially in digital design. Not only that, their inspirations derive from their passion for contemporary art, functionalism and architecture which I draw inspiration from as well. Bringing in these inspirations which originate in physicality to a digital realm is challenging, but if applied correctly, can create surreal experiences while still purposeful.<br />

            <br />I appreciate their works for being ahead in not only the graphical trends, but also in the technology they use to build their projects. Most of the times, websites, especially tech-based, will look corporate or “techy”, but in Rezo Zero’s works, they are particular and minimal with their choice of fonts, colors, negative space, and graphics.
